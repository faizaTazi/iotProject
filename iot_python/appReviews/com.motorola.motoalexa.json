The app was made \nfor Moto devices which means the total number of possible devices can't be \nthat large and if it requires the Alexa Moto Mod, it should just say so. If \nanything this app has caused me to like Moto and Alexa even less. [UPDATED] \nStill unable to get \"Voice Activation\" to work. Since this app requires me \nto \"push a button\" to activate it's 100% pointless considering the actual \nAmazon Alexa app requires the same and can do more. Please, someone, \nexplain the point of this app.",

Unfortunately, the app needs some serious work and I encourage you to fix some major issues like lack of follow-up responses in skills (it won't make it through 3 questions playing Jeopardy before just shutting down) and continuous false activations even with customized training.  But my biggest issue is this: before one of the recent updates, Moto Alexa made a notification sound immediately after hearing the wake word.  Now, the sound is made after \"Alexa\" is heard and a command is initiated.  This is fine if you are always looking at the screen to see if the app is listening, but I am disabled and use the phone with a headset.  My voice is very weak and isn't consistent throughout the day saying the \"Alexa\" command (even with multiple attempts at training).  Three fourths of the time, my phone does not recognize me saying the command so I have to just stand there looking like an idiot saying over and over \"Alexa what time is it\" not knowing whether it even heard me or not.  Before, I could just say \"Alexa\" and wait, and if I didn't hear the notification sound, I would know.  Please make this at least an option in the configuration screen",

In my opinion updates should be being released weekly to patch and fix the bugs but it would appear this particular Amazon echo Experience is being left out and is failing miserably.
