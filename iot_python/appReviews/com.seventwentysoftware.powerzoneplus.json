It's especially fulfilling to be able to see my fitness improvement over time. 2) Having an at-a-glance view of all my PRs ranked in order and grouped by length of the ride and being able to access the info/graph of the PR rides right away. These features fill a hole left by the official Peloton tablet/app. Even though the name refers to Power Zone training, the features of the app can apply to any and all types of Peloton rides. The developer is passionate about his app and it shows with his quick and detailed responses to any questions or concerns with the app. It sounds like there are some exciting features on tap for Version 2.0 and I can't wait! For anyone hesitant to pay for the full version, go for it, you won't regret it!",
