The best thing is that instead of simple on/off , one can always set the preferred temperature, swing and speed. Well, that is cool. It works great with Alexa.

Now if it were able to show energy used per unit time, that would be useful. So far, I have not figured out how to connect a second, my wife's, Android phone.

Here are some of my observations: Installation: Installation and configuration of the Wi-Fi device using SmartHVAC App was extremely simple. I just followed the steps they mentioned in their user manual and everything was up and running in less than five minutes... Good one! Remote Control: I can now control my AC irrespective of my location. Means I can control it from my office, from kitchen or wherever using my Samsung smartphone. A complete flexible system.... Love it! Scheduling: I really really love their scheduling feature. Would have never thought this will become possible for mini-split ACs too. Really Cool, MRCOOL... Alexa: Alexa integration was seamless and easy. I enjoy controlling my AC through Alexa. There are various other features too e.g. Geo-fencing, air filter status etc. which I have not used yet but hope they should also work the way other features are working. Superb tech effort!!!",
