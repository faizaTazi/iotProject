Now each camera (4 of them) take 30 seconds to load when sliding screen to advance to next camera, the \"video history\" playback is in slow motion now and lags awfully and not to mention the app continues to freeze randomly at will.

I hate it when manufacturers spoil there own products via updates I avoided the likes of NEST and RING because I thought EZVIZ would offer more freedom.. but if you're just going to be Apple-esque and use your power of software updates to force ads and subscriptions on to us or make our perfectly functioning devices stop working they we've learnt to expect them to then I won't be buying any more of your products. UPDATE: problem solved. Uninstalled the version I got from Google Play and google for an older version.. now I can play back my alert recordings fine, view my feed in landscape like I could before I'm not pestered to try the god dam \"could\" trial and best of all.. no more more updates to stop things getting broke in the future.",

I can log in and live view my DB1 doorbell cam and history just fine, but it will not ring my phone (Pixel 3), or my wife's phone (Galaxy S10), or my iPad with any consistency whatsoever. I even signed up for the $60/yr cloud plan, still does not work. The only time it rings my Pixel 3 is if the phone is on and I am looking at the app. My wife's phone is a little better, it rings 1 out of 5 times. iPad never rings. I can view it from my Google smart display, but it won't ring that, either. They should remove the doorbell button from the DB1 because it is completely useless as a doorbell.",
