(eg some shortcut or widget to change state between \"home/away\" and a possibility to define alarm security action depending on schedule. eg: only alarm in case of unknown face at night to avoid false alarms during the day) There also seems to be an issue with the geolocation, it never seems to detect it properly.

Now I would estimate facial recognition works 20-30% of the time, if that. Not only that, but to call the live stream 'live' is a bit of a joke. Most of the time there is a 5-10 second delay which I assume is because of the facial recognition but since that doesn't work great either its just a pain. The geofencing doesn't seem to work either. It did when I first got the camera and app but no longer does. I definitely wouldn't recommend this for anything more than a little gimmick to show your friends.",

The alert zones are a little limited with the minimum size and shape being quite a large rectangle but they're good enough. Uploading to my Dropbox account also works well although I did set the image quality to medium in order to conserve space.

This then requires me to manually update the app to say I've left, otherwise we won't receive notifications of any activity seen by the camera and therefore adding a manual step where I have to check that it has me marked away from home. The movement detection is generally accurate, although it quite often seems to identify movement with a person but not see their face for identification. Definitely room for improvement but the quality of video is good and face recognition a good idea. It's emerging technology so don't expect perfection.",

        "content": "The app freezes a lot for me. The light does not go out even after I choose auto in settings telling it to come on only if a 'person' is seen. However sometimes it does not make the distinction. Also, I thought the camera records every five minute intervals but there have been large gaps. The camera and light suit their purpose but the software let's both down. Sometimes the light comes on too late and goes off too early, despite the 'alert zone' being set. I would prefer sharpness and consistency in the software, it is clumsy at  times ...for example the camera keeps picking up a car as a person, not all the time does it do this, but sometimes. Why? Its great that I can view what is happening at home from anywhere but it is only when I am at home can I pick up that the light is not turning off or that a car is being taken for a person. Please fix if possible. It would be good to have a timer on the light too, for exple it stays on for 10s etc. Otherwise this is a fantastic product and I have no regrets in buying it...but it needs some improvements for me personally. The light is impressively bright. Its staying on longer than necessary can be annoying to our neighbours or road users as we are on a busy road. I have clicked on 'improve detection' but, not so good. Its good but can be so much better. Thanks.",

The app in short is underdeveloped and under-supported. There are numerous bugs which don't seem to be addressed including, unresponsive at telling welcome all have left or individual people have left, not loading thumbnails or only loading half of them, not loading video, crashing, and generally a slow and clunky experience. The algorithms behind detection are in need of a serious update, sunlight on cars sets off alerts, improve detection option does nothing as it still identifies the same events incorrectly. Additionally, welcome not recognising pets unlike the presence means a house with animals has many alerts a day. There is a high number of false positives that leads to alarm fatigue which defeats the purpose of having a security product in your home. Also I would be interested to know where the logs for the device are kept, as anything on my network should be reporting to my SIEM. When first looking at home security the choice was between Netamo or Nest, after considerable time using netamo I can honestly say I wish I picked Nest. Hopefully things improve or it may just be worth sinking the cost and buying another product.",
