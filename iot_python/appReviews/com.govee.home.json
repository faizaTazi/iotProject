I really wonder if the management of this company actually believes that there are a bunch of people who love their product. Wake up. Look at your reviews. The two marketing tabs are completely ridiculous and make me angry considering that the product doesn't work as advertised. I'd suggest you learn about customer service, first solve the basic needs of your customers before trying to excite them, otherwise they get angry, like I am. The integration with Alexa doesn't work and even if it does, it doesn't show up as a device, you are just supposed to ask your smart home the temperature, which should be marketed as such. The app needs to do a better job at suggesting other solutions. Move customer support as a tab and make the marketing one options for people who have had a good experience. Overall I would not recommend this app (or the product). Find another that works well with Tuya or at least has a proper integration. Too bad really.",

Should be able to rearrange scenes and group them in app for better organization. Fade / Jump speed slider needs a numeric value (seconds). Recently used colors in color picker would be helpful. 2) Not sure if this is a Google API thing, but better integration with Google Assistant. I'd like to be able to choose a present or custom DIY scene thru voice. Right now I can only control brightness and solid color thru voice. 3) Finally, if able, be able to change source of music mode from the in-controller mic to a phone, Google speaker, or any other smart device, bandwidth allowing.",

Reduce fonts or gaps so more can be seen at same time. 4. Each time I click on a device it does full update sync, even within seconds apart. So going back and forth looking at graphs it's draining both batteries, device and phone. 5. Need option to see all devices in one graph. 6. Need option to input chart graph range (high/low) at set numbers. As example, my temp graph showing 71 to 72, but humidity 55 to 75 over same period. Yet charts look the same, when I would rather see temp chart holding steady, yet humidity wild up and down.",
