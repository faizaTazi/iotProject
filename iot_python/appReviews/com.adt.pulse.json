A true panic button needs to be integrated into the Pulse app, with a widget that can be put on a home screen or dock for quick access. Everything ADT needs to know in order to send help to my house is already in my account. I don't want or need 'guardians' to be contacted! I just want a button that, when pushed, tells ADT to send the police, no ifs, ands, or buts about it, just *do* it. I paid several thousand dollars for my ADT Gold system, and it's appalling that something as obvious as a panic button isn't included with it. Finally, I don't like needing multiple apps, all for ADT. As it is, there's Pulse, MyADT, and now SoSecure. Wrap all their functionality into ONE app--and give it a true panic button! --------------------------- This app is okay, except for one glaring omission: a panic button. Say you're in your house, daytime, alarm not set, and armed burglars break in. Wouldn't you want a panic button on your phone to instantly notify ADT and the police? I do.",
