        "content": "Update on 12/9/2018: lowered to 3 stars. App widgets no longer work with Samsung s9+. By no longer work I mean it works 10% of they time. One widget seems to always fail. It has a scene with 5 commands. Update on 10/5/2017: I do like this app still but I wish the widgets would notify me that they ran successfully. When I run a widget to set the alarm from work or the store (bc I forgot to set it when I left), I find myself double checking in the main app. Defeats the purpose of having the widget. Original: I use GE zwave plus switches with this app. Works great. Small delay sometimes up to 5-10 seconds but normally around 2-3 seconds. I'd imagine that is more the devices and distance more than the app itself. Overall I'm really satisfied and my wife loves just pressing the movie scene from the couch. App has widgets for Android OS that allows me to run scenes right off the home screen. I have 6 devices currently and I might get more but just did the essentials for now bc it's cost $$$$. Can't wait until these switches are just the norm.",

Men after 3 months they told me I would have to pay for a technician to come out and look at it and repair it I said I wasn't going to pay for it because it never work properly in the first place and here is my troubles begin want me to pay $140 for the technician to come out and install it correctly and when they did come on a different day, I told him I would not be paying for his labor.  he said that was fine. This guy did a great job he informed me that they never correctly install the system in the first place I need a WiFi enhancer in the doorbell wasn't properly install I spoke to a rep on the phone the same day we had his labor waive and the enhancer part waived until it was time to pay. I need to try to pull a fast one and try to take it directly out of my auto pay monthly billing account can't get any justice or respect as a customer suck right off the beginning. Had this service since June and here it is January 2018 because my camera off and I can't get it or go action. I never been satisfied and I will stop paying for this.
