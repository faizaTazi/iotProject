As much as I like Jibo, I would suggest you keep your wallet in your pocket till he gets more apps and abilities. Not worth the price :-(",

This tells me that they knew they shouldn't have released this brick until it was more in line with what they claim. $900 for an underdeveloped infant piece of plastic? There is no story telling, no video communication, no food ordering, no voicemail checking and the picture quality is absolute junk. Watch the ad; it shows you everything jibo does NOT do.",
