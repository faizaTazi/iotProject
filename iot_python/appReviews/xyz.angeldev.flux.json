Also it needs to hone in on the beat more instead of playing every note which becomes unintelligible chaos. A configurable low pass filter would be nice too--the loudness and duration filters aren't good enough. As is, I won't use this app. It gives me a headache. I regret paying for premium.",

Since the Playstation doesn't offer any hue apps, this is app is a great option. I like that it doesn't use the microphone and instead directly uses the music stream to alter the lights. It is also great that the free version supports all lights. This gives a good hint what to expect from the full version. And I was not disappointed when I switched to the full one. Great app.",
