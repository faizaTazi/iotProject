They should put a warning on the website and anywhere Awair devices are sold so that people know not to buy. I was lucky to have an old phone lying around that I could set it up with.  The app's notifications are very aggressive. It tells you every time any attribute of the air changes in any way, i.e. every few minutes. The only viable option is to completely disable all notifications.  It also desperately needs to be possible to set preferences for temperature. The temperature in my home is 16\u00b0C, which I consider to be the perfect temperature, but the Awair's 5 star rating considers it to be the 2nd worst and gives me a million tips on how to make it warmer. If I wanted it warmer I would put the heating on. I am sitting in my underwear and it is perfect for sleep. The suggested 22-26\u00b0C is insane, that's hotter than summer and I am unable to sleep at that temperature.  Temperature is a preference, and varies by age or sex, so I don't need a company decreeing that the temperature is \"unsafe\" in my home.",

Once paired, everything worked perfect. At least until I unplugged it and moved it to a different room. The VOC was stuck on -189 for a full day. And the wifi was very buggy (blinking purple dot every five minutes or so). Had to physically reset it in the end. It seemed like all the other measurements were also off in that period. Temperature dropped by ~4\u00b0C after the reset, CO2 shot up from 200 to 400 etc. The wifi problem also seems resolved now.  The reset seems to solve all these issues, but doesn't increase my confidence. Awair firmware version is 1.2.6 and the app version is 1.6.0.  The settings menu is also not completely clear.
