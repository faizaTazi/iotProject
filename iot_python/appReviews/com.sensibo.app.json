The new paid \"Plus\" thing is a bit disappointing but at least its only for features that the app didn't have before. $2.99/month is a bit steep considering the cost of these devices to start with. My justification of the up front cost that \"you're paying up front for what would usually be a subscription\" is a bit harder to sell now. As long as you dont lock other existing features under the pay wall, all is good in my eyes.",

I understand that there are 1000s models around the world. I heard that their support is excellent.

Statistics are missing (like amount of time the AC was on or cooling/heating etc, estimated power consumption etc). Missing ability to control all the devices at once in a house (and not each AC individually). \"Climate react\" only works in 1 degree increments and is very limited (only 2 states of the AC can be set, like heat and cool or cool and off or dry and off, it's kind of useless this way). \"Climate React\" is missing from scheduler and would be a lot more useful instead of just on/off. Scheduler is kind of basic, the list of scheduled events should be grouped by room and should provide more info like the settings of the AC. I can't tell how schedule, location awareness and climate react work together and which of them has precedence over the other. There are other bugs like sometimes needing manual refresh to update status.",

Please fix and i'll change back to 5 stars. Original: It took 2 mins to set up with the new sensibo sky...very slick! It works flawlessly with my fujitsu heatpump.
