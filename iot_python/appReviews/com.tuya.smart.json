First they try to milk companies such as Tuya, already committed to their platform, now they are trying to 'charge at both ends' via a 'subscription model' to milk the consumer as well. I can now imagine why Tuya felt the need to made a stand. Perhaps all their connected companies should? Personally, I'm having none of it - I've pulled all of my IFTTT bespoke widgets and will find an alternative solution, or just live with it. IFTTT has some value but it is far from indispensable, or perfect. Meanwhile, sorry Tuya for writing the below review originally! This app and your Smart Life apps are good and have built in features which I may need to rely on, now I've shut down my IFTTT widgets. ORIGINAL REVIEW WAS: It has become useless to me now that Tuya have abandoned IFTTT. My smart devices were ALL sold to me as supporting IFTTT. And they did. But now they don't. Like many other people, I don't necessarily want to automate everything using voice but rather to implement controls using intelligent macros from any IT platform, especially Windows - which Tuya apps don't support. Smart life gadgets claiming to support IFTTT are now misdescribed! Certainly, while this situation persists, I won't be purchasing or recommending any further smart gadgets that require either the Tuya or the Smart Life apps. *** and it used to be so good *** TUYA - ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM VERY SOON OR EXPECT MORE PEOPLE TO VOTE WITH THEIR FEET!!",

All my routers are 2.4GHz only, I even tried to turn off all but one of them and it still didn't connect. And the AP method doesn't work because when Android discovers that there is no internet in the WiFi it's connected to, it connects to a different access point automatically and there is no way to disable it.",

You cannot arrange for easy reading. What you have programmed stays that way. 2. Voice prompt cannot work independently, ie. If i plug in an external siren, there will be a chirp each time i disarm or arm. It is very annoying so eventually i turn it off. This needs serious correction. 3. Unable to delete logs. Hope the developer will take note.",

The video quality is terrible, looks like your on LSD. The app Tuya Smart that it comes with is very slow to react if you can even get it to connect as it keeps saying click to connect most of the time, with only very basic settings. If you want more notifications and cloud storage you have to pay them a subscription. You are not able to use your own cloud server. Yes it's a rubbish app keeps losing link with phone and doorbell and it is the worst picture quality ever. If you're in full screen mode on your phone it pixelats and looks like you are on hallucinogenic drugs. I thought I might be able to use another app with it but after trying the best apps it appears it's locked to this rubbish app that is dead slow even when it wants to connect. I will be returning this faulty doorbell for a full refund, very annoyed by spending a day testing this.",
