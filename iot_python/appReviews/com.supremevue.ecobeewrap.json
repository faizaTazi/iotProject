Weather being a feature is not really needed since the thermostat already gives weather information or you can easily get that via weather apps and the web.",

This is a maturing product that is well on its way to becoming the preferred phone app for managing an Ecobee stat. Kudos for a job well done.",

Official app is fairly convoluted. - See runtime report (only available online)  Ecobee Wrap does all the above in a simple and basic interface.

Nice work, so far, and definitely an app worth paying for if those improvements are made.",

The interface is not all that inspiring.... hopefully the developers can figure out a way to make it look less like it was designed in the '90's but keep the simplicity.",
