I \nalso have a fire detector with a Roost battery in both my house garage and \npole barn (smoke detectors are not suitable for unheated spaces, so a fire \ndetector that detects and alerts on rate of heat rise is the way to go). \nLastly, I have a couple Roost water detectors in the basement (one by the \nwater heater, and one by the sump pump. I have a separate wifi router in \nthe pole barn to support wifi, streaming, and the Roost battery in the fire \ndetector. Overall, the system works great. The Roost app is installed on \nevery smart device we have (kids & wife's iPhones, an iPad, an Android \ntablet and an Android phone. All alert reliably. Great peace of mind - \nespecially when not at home or kids are alone in the house. Fantastic \ninvestment. We did have a challenge early in the product's launch with \nAndroid alerting properly. An e-mail to their support brought a prompt \nattentiveness and an app update that they confirmed with us that it \nresolved the problem. Very pleased",
