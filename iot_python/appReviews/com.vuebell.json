Seems like they have more budget or resources to spend on the app improvement. Apps is 10 times better now. One last complain is only the fact that if I reboot my WAP, it will not work as well with the sound. I had to reboot it by unplugging it from power.

It is very quick (seconds) to alert me to visitors breaking the motion beam or when the doorbell is pushed. Pictures for motion, video for when doorbell is pressed. Love the live view very much! Sometimes the voices on both sides of the conversation lags but not all the time.True the blue doorbell light is hard to see during daylight but is does come with 2 plastic stickers that says Push Here. It has a very large field of view. The clarity is pretty good except for peoples faces for some reason. The motion area / sensitivity can be expanded to fit your needs. I've had  zero false alerts in about 20 days. My porch is high so I only get alerted to people about 1/2 up 7 stairs. If I could point it down some I guess it would do better. Its a fairly large doorbell, I could only screw in the left side due to my sidelights being narrow. So I made a wood mount its very sturdy regardless.",

Further than it needs to but that's okay because it doesn't hardly use any phone battery. I love the ability to answer the bell with the phone! Never had a crash... Only issue I really have is the backlighting at times so the image looks more like a shadow so I can not always make out who is at the door but then I just speak through my phone and ask our have them step back some.",
