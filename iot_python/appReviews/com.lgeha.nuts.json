I have no other LG smart things than my LG TV still it wants to get access to location, which might be fine, and to make phone calls. And this later is totally unacceptable for an app that supposed to manage devices at my home. It will not even start if I refuse to give access. It could start with reduced functionality but no it will not start at all. LG mentions here under an other review they need this to get location, but I am sorry I don't think this is the best and only way to do it. Anyway they shouldn't force people for an app like this to give access to make phone calls. Now it seems I lost my TV remote on my phone. Old one is still working but who knows how long.",

Add new option for this total 5 hours first 2h set point 23 next 2h set point 22 and last 1h set point 20. If you can give us to add schedule with different temperature and several time periods great options for all users.",
