In my case, controlling blinds with the previous app was great: I could have 3 positions with my blinds: fully opened, fully closed, and a 3rd state that you could program by pressing the pause button. The new app does not allow it because it only has up/down buttons, and the percentage slider does not seem to work with my blinds at all: they only go all the way up or all the way down. I also want to request an app version for tablets, or alternatively allow this version to have landscape mode. I have a tablet attached to a wall that I use as a control center for my home, but I cannot use this new version of the software because it only works on portrait mode.",

This is not very stable. When reinstalling the app I get to sign in again - which seems to be a good thing to get it working. I have been using Home Center 2 for about three years now, and I have three devices. All running perfectly. The old app has been great. But after buying HC3 a week ago, I had to move to the new Home Center app - and forecfully had to reinstall my entire home as the configuration couldn't be transferred between HC2 to HC3. This didn't make my day - I can tell you that. Frustrating and loads of work, and now the app I have to use has to be reinstalled several time per day. I wish you had some help to give, but all you do so far is give excuses. This is not very pleasent for customers like me with (now) four Home Center-devices and more than 150 sensors/switches/locks. Also - the new web page for HC3 is a bit strange as I can't find a way to dim lights. Only switch on/off? And RGBW-devices? Only on and off? Are templates missing in HC3? Other than that I enjoy the web interface for HC3. But the app (which this review was supposed to be about) is not very stable, functional nor near the intuitive interface you had in the old app. Sorry!",
