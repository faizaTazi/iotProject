        "content": "Just installed this system last week. So far, so good. It is very easy to install and activate. The key pads are easy to use and understand. The only drawback is the chime alerts that emit when you need to enter your security code. The volume of the alerts is extremely low, and my wife will forget and open a door when in the \"home\" mode. Luckily, I have been nearby a key pad each time so far and I disabled the system. I have seen many suggestions that this be addressed by SimpliSafe. So, I will add my 2 cents here as well and suggest the same. Increase the chime alert volume in the system.",

Don't get the key fob, i have set the alarm with the fob and came home to not an armed house, waste of money just use the app. Had false alarms and no help from the company but found out the sensor was too far from the base station. I got the outdoor setup for the cameras. I am VERY disappointed with the cameras. You can't see the camera history at a certain time. It's only live or IF it picks up motion. The cameras will pick up cats and deer but not humans, what's up with that?!",

But that's about it. You can't see your individual devices or even see if there's an error in your system. For example, today, on my keypad panel, I saw there was an error with one of my sensors. It flashes by really quickly so I had to try several times to see what device it was. This error does not show up in the app anywhere. It also does not even list all your sensors. It would be so very helpful if the app told you that one of your sensor was malfunctioning and which one. Or give you a list of all your sensors and which one is open. But all it really gives you is \"Turn on/off your alarm\" and \"View camera\". I had to go to their website and login there to see the error and which sensor was causing the error. The app is sadly incredibly simplistic for such a sophisticated system. Very very disappointing.",

I was confident I could go over and have the system up and running in minutes like I had initially done with my system. What a shock. Now, customer service told me I can use a laptop or other computer to setup the system. I am currently waiting for a response request for a step by step instruction on how to do that.

CONS - I liked the old system that had a PANIC button on the keypad. Pretty important when it's next to the door. - I miss having the \"Panic\" button on the key fob, but it is what it is. - When installing new Smoke Detectors (etc.. directions say to press the test button). Which causes the Alarm monitoring company to call. We spoke 4 times during the set up process. Yikes, I felt bad for them. Love this new system and are so happy we upgraded. I would highly recommend it.",

I have a large home with high ceilings, and the tone emitted when the doors are opened is difficult to hear upstairs. I was a offered a discount on a siren that would \"mimic\" the tone from the base station, but was disappointed that I would have to pay for another accessory.

I do have to compliment your monitoring service for such fast responsiveness, outstanding. Thank you also for reaching out so fast to work out a resolution too.
