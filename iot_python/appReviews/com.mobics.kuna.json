Two weeks of phone calls and emails including a video I up loaded for the tech support they agreed to replace the 2 week old lantern. Took 6 months for the replacement to arrive being they were back ordered. For the last year I have had some issues with the cameras going off line. Got used to it. I also had up graded to the AI premium version of the app. Don't waist your money. The AI settings never seem to set the motion detectors off no matter how they were set up. I just left it turned off. Only benefit was the amount of down loads allowed. One week after the warranty had expired the flood lamp has now crapped out. The WiFi part of the flood lamp is shot. A closer look there was moisture in the sensor so I'm sure that's what did it in. Great idea but the software and lamps need tweaking!",

        "content": "I'm not sure why people have negative experiences. For the most part I am happy with it. The service is free unless you want to pay for more. I have yet to pay so I cant speak for the pay services. It keeps the videos for 2 hours before deleting them. I have had no issue with that. It does occasionally delay your alert to your phone, but most of that is related to wifi. I always get alerts if I am away from home. The only issue I have had is if my phone is connected to wifi and I go out into my backyard where my signal is weak. It doesn't alert me until I get closer to the house again. If I am out there and using 4G it is fine. You cant blame that on Kuna though. That is signal strength which they dont control. Also, I have 2 floodlights and 1 Toucan. The floodlights have amazing lighting and present a great picture at night. The toucan isn't as good for me, but again it is not there fault. My existing porch light is not great and I have the camera mounted to the side. Therefore there is not enough light emitted to create as good of a picture at night. I bought one of the Maximus porch lights with the built in camera to replace it, so I expect it to be better once I replace it. There are a couple of things I would like to see change in the app. 1) If I set off one alarm I would like for all of the alarms to go off. 2) I would like to be able to create my own message. There should at least be a lot more options. 3)The button you have to press to speak should be an on / off operation. Right now you have to hold it on to speak and let go before you hear the other person. 4)Sometimes there is a lag of a few seconds. No lag please!!!! ***Also to note. These cameras are way cheaper than other brands. If you look online at a certain wholesale store, you will be surprised how cheap the floodlights are.",

The recording works fine but if someone is at the door you cannot talk or view in real time. Pretty worthless since you have to go to the door to see who is there..also since the last update I'm getting my notifications that someone is at the door 4 1/2 hours after they were recorded. Got an 8:52 am notification at 1:30 pm...What good is that? Someone could steal my stuff and I wouldn't know until they were long gone.",

Their support says to turn the sensitivity down, then it doesn't even pick up my car coming up the driveway. But it still gets a false hit when a car is sitting in my driveway that it never picked up. It reports that it was caused by the the car sitting in the driveway when actually it was caused by a car that drove by on the street that was in the excluded area. They clearly have some software issues. I can see why Costco has dropped them from their website. A real shame this is much better than Arlo overall. They just need to fix a few things. My biggest complaint about the app is you can't select multiple recordings to delete. Your either delete them one at a time or all of them. Also there is no way to stop the recordings. You can stop the alerts but it still records. Then you have to go in and delete them one by one. I have sent several screen shots and videos to support but so far the only response has been to lower the sensitivity. Since I got 3 devices from Costco I'm going to keep trying to get it to work. I already returned Arlo system to Costco this one is getting close to being returned too.",

If you want to set up an alert while you're out of town,  sometimes my next door neighbor leaving will trigger it, but sometimes a guy coming straight up to my door and dropping a pamphlet won't. This varies. There's no rhyme or reason to it. It's sometimes great but often poor. Not reliable.  Bell rings while we're asleep. Grab a phone and check! Between 2 tablets and 2 phones (mix of Android and Apple, all modern) one may work, two may work, or none may work. It's a crapshoot. So we paid for the first year at a rebate but we never re-upped. THIS is why. It's SO unreliable. I'm not paying for this monthly. We paid a low cost for the initial buy as early backers so I'm cool with that. We're selling soon and these will be left behind. I'll be getting a real set up with a reliable app in our new home. My network is solid af (120/30) and I work IT, networking. Not a novice.",
