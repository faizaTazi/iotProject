While I'm awake this is fine, because I can hear the white noise.  At night when I'm sleeping, I'll have no idea the app is no longer working.     2. It can take awhile for the app to reconnect to the camera after my phone switches access points.  Maybe I'm impatient, but, it seems that I sometimes have to restart the app in order for it to connect to the camera.   3. The notifications are always on (I haven't found a way to turn them off without disabling them completely), so if my son wants to play in his room during the day I'm bombarded by constant sound/noise notifications.   4. I have auto-rotation turned off for my display.  There's no way to see the video full screen without enabling it.  Most video apps I have used have a way to make the video full screen without rotating the phone.   5. I wish there were more settings for the \"audio unit\".  I want to make it always play the audio feed.  I don't have high faith that the audio unit is always connected, so this would help me trust it.",
