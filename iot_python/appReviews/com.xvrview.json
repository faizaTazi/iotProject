You'd need to setup 2 versions on your device one for home use, which assumeing you have wifi, which will generate a public IP address for your connection. You'd also need your ISP to enable port forwarding, which allows you outside access to the device, for example when you not at home or using your mobile data to access the cameras when using a different IP. I personally tried a few apps, this one is the easiest.",
