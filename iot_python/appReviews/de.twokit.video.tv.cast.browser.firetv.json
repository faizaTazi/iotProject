I paid for the app, I just want to use it without interruption. Edit: I have tried everything inside the FAQ, the app is pretty much useless most of the time. I'm not prepared to spend hours every day turning on and off the Fire Stick and wifi in the hope that your app might decide to start working. How about you work to ensure basic functionality.",
