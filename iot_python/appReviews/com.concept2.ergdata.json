However, after spending some more time with it, I've finally got it working, and it's not bad at all. However some of my previous criticisms still stand. (1) The website make no mention of OS compatibility beyond 4.2 JellyBean which was 2012. (2) There is a lack of instruction generally about the bluetooth connectivity. Here are my top ErgData Bluetooth tips. (a) If Ensure that you pair the devices from ErgData app and not the Android settings. (b) Make sure the PM5 is set to Wireless ON (this does not seem to be retained) (c) Even if the ErgData app says it is connected under the bluetooth settings, don't believe it until you see a message that says \"ready for workout\" (or words to that effect) in green at the bottom of the ErgData screen.",

Well, My partner and I had to switch to the USB connection because bluetooth wasn't reliable enough over the course of a workout and the app couldn't recover effectively from a dropped connection even though the PM5 was still collecting data. Not a huge issue but dumb. My recurring problem with the app is that when you're finished with a workout, the app appears to automatically detect it and pop up a tiny dialog box asking if you're done. This is the only way to save your workout on the app, and if you touch the screen anywhere but the even tinier \"YES\" on the dialog (can just a word without a border even be called a \"button\"?), your workout data vanishes from the app. There is no other way to save the workout data from the app but that dialog, and it will only show up once so you better hit that \"button\" exactly right the first time. Yes, you can enter the data manually and yes, you can save it on the PM5, copy it off to USB, and upload it to the logbook. Both of these methods make me question why I'm bothering with the app at all. Overall the app needs to be more robust and fault tolerant.",

Plus, workouts that have been completed and recorded to the Concept 2 but have not been caught by ErgData due to failure or otherwise, are not picked up from the C2 and are therefore not synced. Unfortunately, sharing problems with the developer the one time I tried was dismissed as my problem and not the app's (Just Row mode never records). What you want to do most of the time is select a workout such as 10000 K and row and this seems to always work. I suggest you get the app and hope that stability cones with time. Most of the time it works fine.",

Especially since the phone's connection works just fine. Giving the app another chance, I thought that i could just manually log my workouts via the app and have it sync with the website. Unfortunately that didn't work either. The app kept telling me that the username/password combo was incorrect. I double checked my logon three different ways and it worked fine, just not through the app. So I unfortunately had to uninstall the app, since it serves no purpose at this point.",

A lot of useful information is displayed on the two screens, but unfortunately most of the info is lost once the workout is over.  As near as I can tell, only basic workout stats are saved to the tablet or synced to the online logbook.  It would be much more useful if I could recall how many calories I burned, or average stroke force or stroke length, but that info isn't saved anywhere. Please put some effort into capturing data beyond the basics.  I'd also like to be able to sync with zone five sporttracks, but that would be a third party solution.
