The Drive Fan doesn't get recognized half the time by the app and I need to reboot the fireboard and this app. Also, the setting that I set are no longer taking effect. The concept is great but the implementation has gone really bad lately. This was my first review below so you can tell at first things were working really well. Having a cloud solution and that I can connect to the fireboard via wireless is a great design. I went through a lot of other brands before finding fireboard. Great product.",

Keep in mind today is Sunday but I sent a message to the company to make them aware of the issue I was experiencing. Within 10 minutes of sending the company an email Steve called me and walked me through the troubleshooting process. Within 5 minutes my issue was resolved. In my opinion the fireboard and the costumer service are both an A\u00f7\u00f7.",
