I wish devices like this would also include a wired ethernet port. Once I got it setup on the iPhone, I was able to log in on my Pixel and everything works fine. That said, the UI is a little confusing. For example, to open the blind you move the slider to the left, but to open the skylight you move the slider to the right. It's fine, but not great. I simply bought Active system so I could open and close from my phone because the physical remotes are big and ugly; I just didn't want them on display in my house. It accomplishes this, so I'm happy, but the Android app really needs work.",
