What would also be nice is a history log including recent significant events. Perhaps some kind of graphical view of the history of activity would be nice. Oh, and colouring on the map as progress is made. All this would be useful and also help sales!",

The app isn't useful when something goes wrong with the mower or to send the mower to a specific part of the map (like a missed spot), or have information on the battery charge or mowed % etc ... the ability to tweak the overlap over the wire would also be really useful. Come on Bosch, one more push you're nearly there!",
