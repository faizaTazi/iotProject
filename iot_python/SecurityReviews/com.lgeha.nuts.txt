There is no reason for an app like this to need those things. This app is supposed to monitor and control my appliances. No way it needs my location or to make calls to do that. LG has no excuse here. After spending some time trying to get it to work, I found that impossible. Uninstalled and will not install it until such time as LG fixes its privacy issues.",

There are even privacy concerns seeing how they want to access your location which is completely unnecessary to run this app. It always has connection issues with Wi-Fi. All I want to do is turn it on when I'm away from home to warm up my office and I would say 10% of the time it doesn't work which is definitely annoying.",
