    "content": "1,Keeps going offline even though it is connected via the wifi internet connection box, 2 ,Their is no button or link to reconnect to the wifi box so you have to uninstall and reinstall, just ask's you to login to account. 3, Does not save images or video to SD card automatically when someone has come to the door. 4, Why does my security keep saying unusual behaviour?. 5, Their is no where to cancel the Cloud Free Trial.
