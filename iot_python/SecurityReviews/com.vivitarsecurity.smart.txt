    "content": "The Camera are great. Operational, very clear picture, great night vision. The cameras get 5 star. The app gets 1 star. Its is minimally functional. Very hard to navigate. My biggest issue... I have multiple cameras, including outdoor and indoor. With the app, you are only allowed to view one at a time. If sakar would like to be considered for any real home security and monitoring, they seriously need to upgrade the software so someone can view multiple (as many as needed) camerafeeds atonce",

But this app is awesome. But could be awesomer if it wasn't soo damn pixilated when I zoom in. A must have app for good security. Especially for all you crack hypes out there. You know who you are!",
