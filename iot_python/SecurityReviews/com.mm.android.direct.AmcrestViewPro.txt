But, the app needs to improve a lot, specifically the playback feature. It should be easier to tap into the SD card recordings of each camera from the app. The app hasn't received an update in half a year, which in apps in general is a big deal. Other cams and their apps are catching up by now and Amcrest will be left behind if they don't pay attention to it.",

    "content": "Lousy app, will not save ANY settings after configuration. Video quality mediocre, even in HD mode from previous app with another 960H device. Grainy videos at best. Program set on DVR, instead of app but, settings remain the same and NO recorded playback found, even though DVR does show recorded events the entire week. I had programmed DVR to record 24/7 in ALL events, copied that to ALL channels. Even in DVR programming, it defaults back when you exit menu and return to setting I just changed, it's back to default settings on ALL channels. My old system was so simple. This DVR don't even support alarms, when movement are sensed by cameras. Yes, there are icons when it detect but, NO audible alarm sound to let us know. Playback search limited to 24 hour only? RIDICULOUS! When we go away on trips/vacation, we CAN NOT access DVR to view/record/save files from thus app!!! If there ever were to be any unfortunate event of a break in we CAN NOT retrieve files as evidence? What's the purpose of security system when you CAN NOT retrieve video evidence??? Is it a APP issue or the DVR? In either case, UNACCEPTABLE system performance. Tried to web access, system keep telling me I got \"wrong pass word\"? Get real, I set the pass word, I can access through DVR but, I CAN NOT even log in through web? Yes, I tried Firefox, Internet Explorer and even Chrome browser, although it recommend you DON'T use Chrome. Fix it! Thinking about returning the DVR and go with another brand. Amcrest had always given me issues, which they CAN NOT fix...their own system?",
