    "content": "Its OKAY, but for a security app I need to be able to arm the system QUICKLY, but even that feature is behind a password or fingerprint which takes a while to do. Half the time the fingerprint isn't accepted (by the app not the phone). It takes WAY too long to view my doorbell cameras and the sensitivity of it is way too high where I had to turn off notifications of motion which defeats its purpose .",

    "content": "Home security system is decent. This accompanying app to run everything is extemely limited. It does not intergrade with Google Home or much anything else. The included Skybell doorbell is third party hardware that requires an additional app to run. Neither Northstar nor Skybell integrate with Google Home. It's frustrating since you have to toggle back and forth between 3+ apps if you run additional hardware like thermostats or wifi light switches.",

Now who gonna stand at keypad to look at their cameras?  The app been dead since getting alarm in September.  I changed my password so many times to be kicked out again again, and again, now still can't get on app, also if I were it will freeze/drop. Saying app stop working. Now the alarm keeps going off when house is secure.  So angry.  I'm still paying old alarm system cameras only luckily I did.  Was broken into right after.  The 2 guys who help run a good game on me to get this alarm, they wouldn't answer my texts or phone calls.  I'm upset with this company.",
