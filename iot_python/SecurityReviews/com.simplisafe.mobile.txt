The only drawback is the chime alerts that emit when you need to enter your security code. The volume of the alerts is extremely low, and my wife will forget and open a door when in the \"home\" mode. Luckily, I have been nearby a key pad each time so far and I disabled the system. I have seen many suggestions that this be addressed by SimpliSafe. So, I will add my 2 cents here as well and suggest the same. Increase the chime alert volume in the system.",

The camera sometimes takes multiple tries to connect. Otherwise the app appears to work fine. My only disappointment with the system thus far has been with the volume. I have a large home with high ceilings, and the tone emitted when the doors are opened is difficult to hear upstairs. I was a offered a discount on a siren that would \"mimic\" the tone from the base station, but was disappointed that I would have to pay for another accessory. The Comcast touchscreen station was much louder.",
