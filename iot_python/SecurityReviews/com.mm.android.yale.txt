    "content": "Bad. Requires location services just to configure WiFi on a camera. Cannot add a camera without sending Yale your location. Cannot restrict cameras to be on local WiFi - the app and cameras must be given web access - essentially the cameras become a security liability. And no information on the actual videol stream address is available in the app or with the camera. I.e. you use this Yale app and suffer the problems whether you want to or not. Oh, and it constantly fails to connect to cams.",
