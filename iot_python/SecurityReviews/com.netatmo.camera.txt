Will do further checks for any other concerns. Would be good for the app to offer a backup per camera as memory cards do eventually fail thus learnt security data is lost.",

Ex: alarme si visage inconnu la nuit uniquement pour \u00e9viter les d\u00e9clenchements non souhait\u00e9s.) Il me semble que la d\u00e9tection via position ne fonctionne pas vraiment. Donc encore des am\u00e9liorations possible via l'appli. Eng: The system works relatively well, but it misses an option to quickly switch between alarm configuration. (eg some shortcut or widget to change state between \"home/away\" and a possibility to define alarm security action depending on schedule. eg: only alarm in case of unknown face at night to avoid false alarms during the day) There also seems to be an issue with the geolocation, it never seems to detect it properly. So they are still some improvements to be done in the app.",

    "content": "We have had our netamo presence and welcome cameras for coming up to a year now so are in a good place to review their performance. The app in short is underdeveloped and under-supported. There are numerous bugs which don't seem to be addressed including, unresponsive at telling welcome all have left or individual people have left, not loading thumbnails or only loading half of them, not loading video, crashing, and generally a slow and clunky experience. The algorithms behind detection are in need of a serious update, sunlight on cars sets off alerts, improve detection option does nothing as it still identifies the same events incorrectly. Additionally, welcome not recognising pets unlike the presence means a house with animals has many alerts a day. There is a high number of false positives that leads to alarm fatigue which defeats the purpose of having a security product in your home. Also I would be interested to know where the logs for the device are kept, as anything on my network should be reporting to my SIEM. When first looking at home security the choice was between Netamo or Nest, after considerable time using netamo I can honestly say I wish I picked Nest. Hopefully things improve or it may just be worth sinking the cost and buying another product.",
