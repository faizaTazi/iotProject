I sent an email addressing my concerns and no response yet! Your camera can't be depended on, hackers or your company security is wacky, losing footage, Recorded videos are damaged by hackers because of your poor security system/services but i dont depends on one product for protection. To your users!!! You install more.",

I used to be able to leave my tablet on as a security monitor. Now I have to click to turn each camera back on every 5 minutes, even when it is plugged in. That's 12 times per hour, or 144 times every 12 hours! The latest update is determined to keep my cameras flipped 90 degrees sideways!!! Grrrrrr!!!!! Stop screwing around with the messed up updates!!!!!",

The customer tel number no work, in the months I have been trying, we resorted to e-mail support which was a joke, 2 days to answer a query it was clear that english was not 1st language",
